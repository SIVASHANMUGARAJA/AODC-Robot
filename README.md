## AODC ROBOT 

This project was generated with [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) Version 2.1.0.

## Development Of Robot
The project is design to build an obstacle avoidance robotic vehicle using ultrasonic sensors for its movement. A microcontroller (ATmega328) is used to achieve the desired operation. A robot is a machine that can perform task automatically or with guidance. The project proposes robotic vehicle that has an intelligence built in it such that it directs itself whenever an obstacle comes in its path. This robotic vehicle is built, using a micro-controller of AT mega 328 family. An ultrasonic sensor is used to detect any obstacle ahead of it and sends a command to the micro-controller. Depending on the input signal received, the micro-controller redirects the robot to move in an alternate direction by actuating the motors which are interfaced to it through a motor driver. Some of the project is built with the IR sensors has its own application so in our project those application is not compactable so we are using ultrasonic sensor.
